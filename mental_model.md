# Mental Model for the Internet

I'm thinking if I can establish a working anology or mental model for the internet, it'll help me better understand how the internet works and operates.

Possible Analogies:
- The mailing system
- The English language

I like *the English language* as my analogy.

---------------------
---------------------

## Setting up the analogy:

In a digital network, devices send messages between eachother in the form of bits. With communicating using English, humans send messages between eachother in the form of sound waves. 

With digital networks there are many ways in which a message can go from one device to another. In English with humans, there are many ways in which a message can go from one person to another.

### The "Network"
Digital: This is the connection between a system of devices that are capable of sharing information and data.


Human: This is the connection between a system of human beings that are capable of sharing information and experience.

### LAN

This is a more localized area in which devices are connected and can communicate in more centralized and direct ways.

This is a group of humans in a localized area who can communicate more directly between eachother.

### Routers / Local Messengers

These are devices that recieve messages from other devices and pass the messages along to other devices

### WLAN

When a local device sends a message to another specialized device that transmits that message through radio waves to other devices in the local area network.

When a local person sends a message to a local messenger (office assistant or intern) to pass on the message to other people in the local area network.
