# Mental Model for the Internet

I'm thinking if I can establish a working anology or mental model for the internet, it'll help me better understand how the internet works and operates.

Possible Analogies:
- The mailing system
- The English language

I like *the English language* as my analogy.

## Setting up the analogy:

In a digital network, devices send messages between eachother in the form of bits. With communicating using English, humans send messages between eachother in the form of sound waves. 

With digital networks there are many ways in which a message can go from one device to another. In English with humans, there are many ways in which a message can go from one person to another.

### The "Network"
Digital: This is the connection between a system of devices that are capable of sharing information and data.


Human: This is the connection between a system of human beings that are capable of sharing information and experience.

### LAN

Digital: This is a more localized area in which devices are connected and can communicate in a more centralized and direct way.

Human: This is a group of humans in a localized area who can communicate in a more centralized and direct way.

### WLAN

Digital: Is the same as a LAN, except its a network that connects devices through the use of radio waves instead of physical wires.

Human: Is the same as a LAN, except its a network that communicates to people through the use of a phone call or intercom instead of running over to the person to devliver communications/messages.

### Routers / Local Messengers

Digital: These are devices that receive messages from other devices and decide the best path to pass the messages along to the respective receiving device. Routers act as a way to connect different networks.

Human: These are local persons who receive messages from other people and decide the best way to pass the messages along to their respective recipient. Local messengers act as a way to communicate between other networks of humans.


### Switches
