What does HTTP stand for?,Hypertext Transfer Protocol
What problem does HTTP solve in the context of networking layers?,"HTTP provides a standardized way for web clients and servers to communicate, operating at the Application Layer"
What are the main components of an HTTP request?,"1. Request Line, 2. Headers, 3. Empty Line, 4. Message Body (optional)"
What does a typical HTTP request line contain?,"METHOD REQUEST_URI HTTP_VERSION (e.g., GET /index.html HTTP/1.1)"
What are the main components of an HTTP response?,"1. Status Line, 2. Headers, 3. Empty Line, 4. Message Body (optional)"
What does a typical HTTP response status line contain?,"HTTP_VERSION STATUS_CODE REASON_PHRASE (e.g., HTTP/1.1 200 OK)"
What is the purpose of HTTP headers?,"To provide additional information about the request, response, or body content"
What is the significance of the empty line in an HTTP message?,"It separates the headers from the message body"
What is the difference between HTTP and TCP?,"HTTP standardizes how to send and receive information between servers and clients, while TCP manages the connection between a server and client"
What layer of the OSI model does HTTP operate on?,Application Layer
What layer of the OSI model does TCP operate on?,Transport Layer
What is a Session ID in the context of HTTP?,"A unique identifier stored in a cookie that represents a user's current session on a website or domain"
What is the purpose of query parameters in a URL?,"To provide additional information to the server, often used to query or filter data"
What is the purpose of the Host header in an HTTP request?,"To specify the domain name of the server (required in HTTP/1.1)"
What is the purpose of the Content-Type header?,"To specify the media type of the body of the request or response"
What is the name of the PDU (Protocol Data Unit) for HTTP?,Message
What are cookies used for in web communications?,"To store small pieces of data on the client-side, often used for maintaining state or user preferences"
What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?,"GET is used to request data from a server, while POST is used to submit data to be processed by the server"
What does it mean that HTTP is a stateless protocol?,"Each HTTP request is independent and doesn't retain information from previous requests"
How do browsers typically handle HTTPS connections?,"They perform an SSL/TLS handshake before sending the HTTP request"
What is the Application Layer?,"The highest layer in the TCP/IP model responsible for passing relevant information for how data is sent and received between applications. It encapsulates data when sending and decapsulates when receiving."
Name three common protocols associated with the Application Layer,"HTTP/HTTPS (web browsing), DNS (domain name IP address look-ups), SMTP (transmitting emails)"
What is the Transport Layer?,"The layer responsible for establishing a logical (not physical) connection between devices, setting rules for data segmentation and flow between devices."
What are the two main protocols used at the Transport Layer?,"TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)"
What is TCP commonly used for?,"Applications requiring reliable, ordered data delivery, such as web browsing, email, and file transfer"
What is UDP commonly used for?,"Applications prioritizing speed over reliability, such as video/audio streaming, online gaming, and DNS lookups"
What is the Internet Layer?,"The layer between the Data Link Layer and Transport Layer, responsible for addressing, routing, and fragmentation of data across different networks"
What is the main protocol used at the Internet Layer?,"IP (Internet Protocol)"
What is the Data-Link Layer?,"The lowest layer of the TCP/IP network model, responsible for device identification, framing, and error detection within a local network"
What is the most common protocol used at the Data-Link Layer?,"Ethernet protocol"
What does HTTP stand for?,"Hypertext Transfer Protocol"
Is HTTP a stateless or stateful protocol?,"Stateless protocol"
What is the HTTP request-response cycle?,"A process where a client makes a request to a server, and the server returns a response to the client"
Name four common HTTP methods,"GET, POST, DELETE, PUT"
What is the purpose of the GET HTTP method?,"Used for retrieving assets or resources from a server"
What is the purpose of the POST HTTP method?,"Used for submitting data to a server to be processed"
What is the purpose of the DELETE HTTP method?,"Used to remove or delete existing data from a server"
What is the purpose of the PUT HTTP method?,"Used to update existing data on a server"
What is HTTPS?,"The encrypted version of HTTP, providing secure communication over a computer network"
What is a network?,"A system of nodes/devices that send and transfer information between each other."
What is a LAN?,"A network of devices located locally, communicating through a central system like a hub or switch."
What is a WLAN?,"The same as a LAN except devices in the local network communicate via radio waves."
What are MAC Addresses?,"'Physical addresses' that devices have, generally unchangeable and used to identify a specific device."
What is a Switch and how does it function?,"A device that connects devices in a local network by using MAC addresses to determine what devices to send data to."
What are IP Addresses and how are they used?,"Addresses given to devices in a local network (usually dynamically from a router) to identify what device to send incoming data to or determine where data is coming from."
What is the primary function of Routers?,"Devices used to connect local devices to the internet, determine best paths for outgoing data, and direct incoming data to correct local devices."
What is a Protocol in networking?,"A set of rules and procedures for how data is formatted, transferred, sent and delivered between devices and networks."
What is multiplexing in networking?,"The process of taking multiple different streams of data from a host and sending them through one channel."
What is demultiplexing in networking?,"The opposite of multiplexing, where a single channel of multiple streams of data is taken and split apart into separate channels."
What are Ports in networking?,"Used to identify the services or applications that are sending or receiving data, helping direct data to the correct application on a host device."
What is a Socket in networking?,"The address that refers to an end-point for data being sent, usually comprising the IP address combined with the port number."
What is a connectionless system in networking?,"A system where data is sent directly to the host machine's socket without establishing a dedicated connection."
What is a connection-oriented system in networking?,"A system where dedicated connections are set up between the recipient host's process and the source host's process, generally considered more reliable."
What is a Web Server in server architecture?,"The part of a server that typically serves static assets like HTML, CSS, and JS files, and can act as a reverse proxy."
What is an Application Server in server architecture?,"The part of a server that handles business logic, updates information, and often creates dynamic changes on the client's end."
What is a Data Store in server architecture?,"Where data is stored in a server, often accessed by the application server for reading or writing information."
What are 'Resources' in web development?,"Files or data requested and loaded by a web browser to render a webpage, including HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos, etc."
What is a reverse proxy?,"A server that sits in front of web servers, forwarding client requests to those web servers and handling tasks like load balancing and SSL termination."
